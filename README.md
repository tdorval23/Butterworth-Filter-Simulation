In-class project where the response of a 3rd-order Butterworth low-pass filter must be simulated and then modeled in MATLAB.
Students were graded based upon the accuracy of their filter simulation. To run, extract the .zip file and then launch each
file in their respective software (LTSpice, MATLAB).
